# Quick-Issue-Tracker

This is a quick issue tracking app I did to practice my local storage &amp; JS skills.

Although the to do list application is a popular project with many programmers, I wanted to do something more business oriented. 

Every business needs a good bug tracker, so here is mine. 

Once a user clicks the add button, the bug tracker reads the data from the page, stores it, calls a function to generate the markup, and finally displays it on the UI.

I used Bootsrap for a clean and simple user interface. 

For the ID's, I used Chance.js so that they would not be the boring ID's of 1, 2, 3, etc... 

Next, I added a button to click to switch the ticket from open to closed, and a way to delete tickets permenantly. 

Finally, I implemented local storage for persistent data.
